 * Taxonomy Template
 *
 * The taxonomy template is the default template used when a taxonomy archive is shown. Ideally,
 * all taxonomies would have their own template (taxonomy-$tax_name.php). The theme has included
 * templates for the default WordPress taxonomies: taxonomy-post_tag.php, taxonomy-category.php, 
 * and taxonomy-link_category.php.
